1. APP Description

My APP is a simple countdown timer that asks the user for the timer that they want to set the timer and what message
they would like to recieve after the timer ends. It uses a box like format to display the timer and it does it in the
hours minutes and seconds format. For example the user can set the time to 5 seconds and the message as boom and when it
is run it would start at 0.0.5 in a box format and count to 4,3,2,1 and then write boom when the timer is completed.
